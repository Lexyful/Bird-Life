## Abstract
birdlife is an app for users who have an interest in bird watching but have little experience in the activity. The app allows a user to look through random pictures of birds on the main page. The gallery page allows the user to select the birds that they've sighted in the wild. The birds that have been selected as "sighted" will then be stored in the sighted birds page. The user can also delete the birds in the sighted birds page if they've clicked the sighted button by accident or wants to sight it again  later.
